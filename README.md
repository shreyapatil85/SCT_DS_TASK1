Age Distribution Histogram 
This project demonstrates how to create a histogram using Python in Google Colab to visualize the distribution of age data.

Description
The notebook contains Python code that uses the Matplotlib library to plot a histogram from a sample list of ages.
The histogram shows how frequently ages occur within specified ranges (bins).

Platform Used
Google Colab (Jupyter Notebook environment)

Python

Matplotlib

How to Run in Google Colab
Open Google Colab

Upload the notebook (.ipynb) or open it from GitHub.

Run the code cell containing the histogram script.

The output histogram will be displayed below the cell.

Code Functionality
Defines a list of age values

Creates a histogram with 6 bins

Labels x-axis as Age

Labels y-axis as Frequency

Displays the histogram output inline in Colab

Output
The program displays a histogram showing the age distribution grouped into six age ranges.
